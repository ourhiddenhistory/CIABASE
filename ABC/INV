TO NURTURE DISTRIBUTED CENTERS OF EXCELLENCE IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR. STEELE SAID CIA IS HAVING AN IDENTITY CRISIS IN LARGE PART BECAUSE IT IS FOUR COMPLETELY SEPARATE FIEFDOMS THAT DO NOT TALK TO EACH OTHER AND ARE NOT BY ANY STRETCH OF THE IMAGINATION RESPONSIVE TO DIRECTION FROM DCI. CIA COMBINES A BLOATED ADM STRUCTURE WITH A HALF-WAY HOUSE FOR TECHNICAL RESEARCH ADDICTS~ AND THEN ADDS BUTTON-DOWN SCHOOL BOYS TRYING TO BE SPIES FROM WITHIN OFFICIAL INSTALLATIONS WHERE THEY ARE EASY TO SPOT~ AND TOPS THIS OFF WITH A WHOLE BUNCH OF ANALYSTS THAT DON'T SPEAK A FOREIGN LANGUAGE~ HAVE RARELY BEEN OVERSEAS~ AND HAVE ALMOST NO ACCESS TO PRIVATE SECTOR EXPERTS IN THEIR TOPICAL AREAS.

WHETHER ROLES AND SHOULD EXTEND BEYOND THE TRADITIONAL AREAS OF PROVIDING SUPPORT TO THE DEFENSE AND FOREIGN POLICY ESTABLISHMENTS~ AND IF SO~ WHAT AREAS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED LEGITIMATE FOR INTELLIGENCE COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS~ AND WHETHER SUCH AREAS SHOULD INCLUDE~ FOR EXAMPLE~ ECONOMIC ISSUES~ AND HEALTH ISSUES? 3. WHAT FUNCTIONS~ IF ANY~ SHOULD CONTINUE TO BE ASSIGNED~ INCLUDING CIA~ AND WHAT CAPABILITIES SHOULD THESE ORGANIZATIONS RETAIN FOR THE FUTURE? 4. DOES EXISTING ORGANIZATION OF THE CIA PROVIDE THE OPTIMAL STRUCTURE TO ACCOMPLISH ITS MISSION? 5. WHETHER EXISTING PRINCIPLES AND STRATEGIES GOVERNING ACQUISITION AND MAINTENANCE OF INTELLIGENCE COLLECTION CAPABILITIES SHOULD BE RETAINED AND WHAT COLLECTION CAPABILITIES SHOULD GVT RETAIN? 6. WHETHER INTEL ANALYSIS~ ADDS SUFFICIENT VALUE TO INFOR OTHERWISE AVAILABLE TO GVT? 7. WHETHER EXISTING DECENTRALIZED SYSTEM OF INTEL ANALYSIS RESULTS IN SIGNIFICANT WASTE OR DUPLICATION? 8. WHETHER EXISTING ARRANGEMENTS OF ALLOCATING AVAILABLE RESOURCES ARE ADEQUATE? 9. WHETHER EXISTING FRAMEWORK FOR COORDINATING AMONG INTEL AGENCIES PROVIDES AN OPTIMAL STRUCTURE FOR SUCH COORDINATION? 10. WHETHER CURRENT PERSONNEL POLICIES AND PRACTICES OF PROVIDE AN OPTIMAL WORK FORCE? 11. WHETHER RESOURCES FOR INTEL ACTIVITIES SHOULD CONTINUE TO BE ALLOCATED AS PART OF THE DEFENSE BUDGET OR BE TREATED AS A SEPARATE BUDGETARY PROGRAM? 12. WHETHER EXISTING LEVELS OF RESOURCES ALLOCATED FOR INTEL COLLECTION OR ANALYSIS~ OR TO PROVIDE A CAPABILITY TO CONDUCT COVERT ACTIONS~ ARE SERIOUSLY AT VARIANCE WITH UNITED STATES NEEDS? 13.

INVESTIGATION OF,@95-96@ ASPIN INTELLIGENCE COMMISSION GETTING UNDERWAY. ITS OFFICIAL TITLE IS THE COMMISSION ON THE ROLES AND CAPABILITIES OF THE UNITED STATES INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY. IN EARLY FEBRUARY 95~ COMMISSION WASN'T YET UNDER WAY BECAUSE PRESIDENT BILL CLINTON STILL HAD TO CHOOSE NINE OF THE REQUIRED 17 COMMISSION MEMBERS. THE COMMISSION SHOULD PRODUCE A REPORT BY MARCH 1996 ON THE FUTURE OF U.S. INTELLIGENCE IN THE POST-COLD WAR WORLD~ AND MR. ASPIN WANTS TO INVOLVE THE PUBLIC. ALREADY ROBERT D. STEELE~ HEAD OF OPEN SOURCE SOLUTIONS~ INC. HAS RESPONDED TO THIS CALL WITH A 20-PAGE DETAILED REPLY TO THE 19 QUESTIONS SET OUT IN THE LEGISLATION THAT CREATED THE COMMISSION. <INT 2/27/95 31
INVESTIGATION OF,@95-96@ COMMISSION ON ROLES AND CAPABILITIES OF THE U.S. INTEL COMMUNITY RECOMMENDS EXPANDED POWER FOR CIA CHIEF. THE SPRAWLING U.S. INTEL LACKS DIRECTION AND IS TOO REMOTE FROM POLICY-MAKERS. IT RECOMMENDED EXPANDING POWER OF THE CIA DIRECTOR AND STRIPPING MILITARY OF ITS AUTHORITY TO RECRUIT SPIES. COMMISSION ESTABLISHED BY CONGRESS SPENT A YEAR STUDYING INTEL COMMUNITY. CIA DIRECTOR DEUTCH SAID HE HAS ASKED PEOPLE FROM DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE INTEL COMMUNITY TO SERVE ON A PANEL TO STUDY RECOMMENDATIONS AND REPORT BACK WITHIN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS. ``THERE'S GOING TO HAVE TO BE SOME MAJOR SHIFTING AROUND OF PEOPLE~'' RUDMAN SAID TO GET RIGHT PEOPLE TO MATCH MISSIONS OF VARIOUS INTEL AGENCIES. 85 PERCENT OF INTEL COMMUNITY IS BEYOND REACH OF THE DCI. COVERT OPS WERE DEFENDED AS PROVIDING THE PRESIDENT ``WITH AN OPTION SHORT OF MILITARY ACTION WHEN DIPLOMACY ALONE CANNOT DO THE JOB.'' THE PANEL TOOK NOTE OF CRITICISM OF THE ``ARROGANCE~ PAROCHIALISM~ DISDAIN FOR OVERSIGHT~ LACK OF DIVERSITY~ AND TOLERANCE OF INADEQUATE PROFESSIONAL PERFORMANCE'' OF THE CIA'S DIRECTORATE OF OPERATIONS (DO). TO OVERCOME THE ISOLATION OF THE DO~ COMMISSION RECOMMENDED THAT CASE OFFICERS BE ROTATED THROUGH ASSIGNMENTS IN OTHER DIRECTORATES. COMMISSION DID NOT ADDRESS ISSUE OF WHETHER THE CIA SHOULD TRY TO RECRUIT JOURNALISTS OR CLERGY FOR SPY MISSIONS OR HAVE ITS OWN AGENTS IDENTIFYING THEMSELVES AS MEMBERS OF EITHER PROFESSION. DEUTCH ACKNOWLEDGED LAST WEEK THAT HE HAS THE AUTHORITY TO WAIVE A BAN ON ATTEMPTING TO RECRUIT JOURNALISTS OR CLERGY. OTHER RECOMMENDATIONS INCLUDE: TO GIVE THE DCI MORE TIME FOR MANAGEMENT OF THE OVERALL INTEL COMMUNITY~ TWO NEW DEPUTY CIA DIRECTORS SHOULD REPLACE THE CURRENT DEPUTY. ONE WOULD DEAL WITH THE INTEL COMMUNITY OVERALL; THE OTHER WOULD CONCENTRATE ON THE DAY-TO-DAY OPS OF THE CIA. TO STRENGTHEN POLICY GUIDANCE~ A COMMITTEE ON FOREIGN INTEL SHOULD BE CREATED WITHIN THE WHITE HOUSE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL AND CHAIRED BY THE PRESIDENT'S NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER. A SECOND NSC COMMITTEE SHOULD BE CREATED TO COORDINATE EFFORTS AGAINST GLOBAL CRIME. NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE COUNCIL~ WHICH PREPARES INTEL ESTIMATES~ SHOULD BECOME A MORE BROADLY BASED NATIONAL ASSESSMENT CENTER AND BE RELOCATED OUTSIDE THE CIA HQS. COMMISSION WAS ESTABLISHED BY CONGRESS IN 1994 AND BEGAN ITS STUDY IN MARCH 1995. IT HEARD TESTIMONY FROM 84 WITNESSES AND INTERVIEWED 200 OTHERS. AP 3/1

BUT THE INTELLIGENCE WAS TOO VAGUE TO BE VERY USEFUL. U.S. OFFICIALS HAVE BEEN TOO RELIANT ON SUCH ^WARNING INTELLIGENCE~^ AND RELAXED IN THE ABSENCE OF INTELLIGENCE REPORTS DESCRIBING SPECIFIC DANGERS. HARSHEST CRITICISM WAS FOR THE FAILURE TO CONTEMPLATE THE TYPE OF TRUCK BOMBS~ IN LIGHT OF THE 1996 TRUCK BOMBING OF A U.S. AIR FORCE DORMITORY IN SAUDI ARABIA~ AND THE DESTRUCTION OF THE U.S. MARINE BARRACKS AND THE U.S. EMBASSY IN BEIRUT IN 1983.

DCI WILL BE UPDATING THE STATE DEPT./CIA ARRANGEMENT. THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR WILL ISSUE NEW STANDARDS FOR SELECTING THE CHIEF OF STATIONS. IG FOUND DEFICIENCIES IN THE REVIEWAL PROCESSES FOR HUMAN ASSETS. THE DDO WILL IMPROVE THE HUMAN ASSET VALIDATION PROCESS. THE REPORT FOUND THAT SOME OF REPORTING BY THE COS IN GUATEMALA ON HUMINT WAS NOT RELIABLE~ CLEAR~ OR ACCURATE. IG'S REPORT RECOMMENDS PROCEDURES TO IMPROVE REPORTING PROCESS USED FOR THE DISCOVERY OF HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES. THE GENERAL COUNSEL WAS PREVIOUSLY ASKED TO LOOK INTO PROCEDURES USED FOR LOOKING INTO ASSETS WHO MAY HAVE VIOLATED US LAW OR ENGAGED IN HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES. RECOMMENDATION MADE BY THE IG ON HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES ALSO URGES A BETTER REVIEWAL PROCESS TO DETERMINE IF THE HUMAN ASSETS ARE INVOLVED WITH NARCOTICS TRAFFICKING OR TERRORISM. DCI AGREED WITH THE IG'S RECOMMENDATION FOR A BETTER REVIEWAL PROCESS BUT POINTED OUT THAT THE AGENCY IS SOMETIMES FORCED TO DEAL WITH INDIVIDUALS ENGAGED IN UNDESIRABLE ACTIVITIES IN ORDER TO GAIN VALUABLE INTEL. THE DCI WANTS DI ANALYSTS TO HAVE GREATER ACCESS TO DO OPERATIONAL TRAFFIC AND OTHER SENSITIVE INTEL. THE DCI SAID HE BELIEVED PROGRESS WAS BEING MADE BUT THAT MUCH MORE COULD BE DONE. HE SAID THAT GUATEMALA IS A PERFECT CASE WHERE MORE COOPERATION WOULD HAVE BEEN HELPFUL. DDO AND DDI HAVE BEEN INSTRUCTED TO WORK ON REMOVING BARRIERS. THE DI MUST ALSO WORK ON IMPROVING THE ANALYTICAL TRADECRAFT. THE REPORT NOTED THE RESPONSIBILITY OF A NUMBER OF SPECIFIC INDIVIDUALS IN THE CIA. THE DCI HAS DIRECTED THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR~ GENERAL COUNSEL~ AND CHIEFS OF STATION TO REVIEW THE RECOMMENDATIONS. INTEL WATCH REPORT - SPECIAL 7/27/95

IN HIS BOOK~ ``AN AMERICAN PRIEST IN HONDURAS~'' CARNEY ADMITTED BEING A MEMBER OF THE POPULAR ARMED FORCES~ THE MILITARY ARM OF THE REVOLUTIONARY WORKERS PARTY.

INVESTIGATION OF,IN @48-49@ TWO IMPORTANT INVESTIGATIONS CONDUCTED. ONE~ THE EBERSTADT COMMITTEE'S REPORT TO THE HOOVER COMMISSION ON THE ORGANIZATION OF THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH OF GVT~ WAS SPONSORED BY CONGRESS. THE OTHER~ THE DULLES REPORT OF THE INTELLIGENCE SURVEY GROUP~ WAS INITIATED BY THE NSC. THE EBERSTADT REPORT SUPPORTED INTEGRATION OF ALL CLANDESTINE OPS IN THE CIA UNDER THE NSC'S SUPERVISION. IN WARTIME THE OPERATIONAL SERVICES WOULD BE TRANSFERRED TO THE JCS. THE DULLES REPORT (OFTEN REFERRED TO AS THE DULLES-JACKSON-CORREA REPORT) WAS LINKED TO EFFORTS BY THE STATE DEPARTMENT TO HAVE COVERT OPS PUT UNDER ITS GUIDANCE. INTEL SURVEY GROUP ESTABLISHED BY THE NSC ON 8 JAN 48. GROUPS CONSISTED OF ALLEN DULLES AS CHAIRMAN~ MATTHIAS CORREA~ AND WILLIAM JACKSON. THEY ASSISTED BY ROBERT BLUM~ AN ASSISTANT OF DEFENSE SECRETARY FORRESTAL. REPORT ACCUSED THE TOP OFFICIALS OF CIA WITH LACK OF LEADERSHIP. GALLOWAY AND WRIGHT LEFT. TCIA INTRO CHAPTER VIII. EBERSTADT REPORT ALMOST IMMEDIATELY ECLIPSED BY THE INTEL SURVEY GROUP AKA DULLES REPORT. <TCIA 284
INVESTIGATION OF,IN @48@ DULLES-JACKSON-CORREA SURVEY COMMISSIONED BY NSC.

IN 85 ADMIRAL TURNER REFERRED TO IT AS ACHILLES HEEL OF INTEL.

INVESTIGATION OF,INDIA~ @98@ A U.S. SATELLITE DEPICTED ACTIVITY AT INDIA'S REMOTE DESERT NUCLEAR TEST SITE~ BUT OFFICIALS FAILED TO DISCERN THAT INDIA WAS PREPARING TO CONDUCT THE [NUCLEAR BLASTS]. EVEN WHEN ^CLEAR-CUT^ EVIDENCE OF THE PREPARATIONS WAS RECORDED BY A SATELLITE~ SIX HOURS BEFORE THE TESTS~ NO CIA WARNING WAS ISSUED BECAUSE THE U.S. ANALYSTS RESPONSIBLE FOR TRACKING THE INDIAN NUCLEAR PROGRAM HAD NOT EXPECTED THE TESTS AND WERE NOT ON ALERT. THEY DID NOT SEE THE PICTURES UNTIL THEY ARRIVED AT WORK. CLINTON DID NOT LEARN OF THIS UNTIL AFTER THE BLASTS HAD OCCURRED~ WHEN NEWS SERVICES CARRIED ACCOUNTS OF A PUBLIC ACKNOWLEDGMENT BY INDIA'S PRIME MINISTER ATAL BIHARI VAJPAYEE. WHEN THE WHITE HOUSE ASKED CIA FOR DETAILS~ IT HAD NONE. THE BLASTS IGNITED FIERCE CRITICISM FROM U.S. POLICYMAKERS~ AND PROMPTED TWO CONGRESSIONAL OVERSIGHT COMMITTEES AND THE CIA TO LAUNCH PROBES OF THE AGENCY'S CONDUCT DURING THE PRECEDING WEEKS AND MONTHS. SEN. RICHARD C. SHELBY~ WHO CHAIRS THE INTEL COMMITTEE~ CONDEMNED THE IC'S CONDUCT~ CALLING THE EPISODE ^A COLOSSAL FAILURE^ THAT BETRAYED A ^DREADFULLY INADEQUATE JOB...^ WE CANNOT MUST NOT TOLERATE SUCH FAILURE ON THE PART OF THE IC~^ HE SAID. DCI TENET APPOINTED A TEAM TO [INVESTIGATE]. THE TEAM IS TO BE HEADED BY RETIRED VICE ADM. DAVID E. JEREMIAH~ A FORMER VICE CHAIRMAN OF THE JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF~ AND REPORT ITS FINDINGS WITHIN 10 DAYS. AMONG THE ISSUES TO BE EXAMINED: IF CIA'S REGIONAL POLITICAL AND MILITARY ANALYSTS OVERLOOKED CLUES~ WHETHER THE NSA MISSED ANY TELLTALE INFO COLLECTED THROUGH ITS WORLDWIDE ELECTRONIC EAVESDROPPING~ AND HOW SPY SATELLITE OPERATORS AND PHOTO ANALYSTS FAILED TO CATCH SUCH ACTIVITIES AS THE BURIAL OF NUCLEAR DEVICES AND THE ATTACHMENT OF CABLES TO TRANSMIT SCIENTIFIC DATA. <WP 5/13/98 A1

THE DEBACLE REVEALED CHRONIC FAILURES OF IMAGINATION AND PERSONNEL~ FLAWS IN INFO-GATHERING AND ANALYSIS~ AND FAULTY LEADERSHIP AND TRAINING~ PER RETIRED ADM. DAVID JEREMIAH. HIS INVESTIGATION~ GAVE A CORE SAMPLE OF THE STRUCTURAL WEAKNESSES IN U.S. INTEL THAT GO FAR BEYOND THE QUESTION OF INDIA. JEREMIAH REPORTED SOBERING REALITIES ABOUT CIA AND ITS SISTER SERVICES: -- CIA HAD NO SPIES WORTHY OF THE NAME IN INDIA. -- ITS ABILITY TO PRY INFO OUT OF PEOPLE IS WEAK WORLDWIDE. -- THE NATION'S SPY SATELLITES PRODUCE FAR TOO MUCH INFO FOR OVERWORKED AND UNDERTRAINED INTEL ANALYSTS. -- IN INDIA~ SATELLITES AND ANALYSTS ALIKE FAILED TO FOCUS ON THE NUCLEAR TEST SITE~ DESPITE CLEAR CLUES THAT A NUCLEAR TEST WAS COMING. SENIOR INTEL OFFICIALS DISCOUNTED THOSE CLUES AND DID NOT ORDER THEIR UNDERLINGS TO EXAMINE THEM. U.S. POLICY-MAKERS AND INTEL OFFICIALS HAD AN ^UNDERLYING MIND-SET^ THAT INDIA WOULD NOT TEST ITS NUCLEAR WEAPONS. THAT FIXED IDEA WAS UNAFFECTED BY INDIA'S NEWLY ELECTED HINDU NATIONALIST LEADERS OPENLY VOWING TO DEPLOY THE BOMB. JEREMIAH~ DESCRIBED A KIND OF INTELLECTUAL LAZINESS AT THE INTEL SERVICES. ^YOU NEED TO HAVE A CONTRARIAN VIEW.^ CIA'S MANAGERS WERE PASSIVE. CIA NEEDS MANY MORE ANALYSTS WITH BETTER TRAINING AND SHARPER SKILLS. IT SHOULD BRING IN OUTSIDE EXPERTS TO ANALYZE MAJOR EVENTS. IT MUST BE ^MUCH MORE AGGRESSIVE IN THINKING THROUGH HOW THE OTHER GUY THOUGHT^ -- BREAKING OUT OF AMERICAN POLITICAL AND CULTURAL PATTERNS TO GRASP THE WAYS IN WHICH THE REST OF THE WORLD THINKS. RARELY HAS A REPORT COMMISSIONED BY CIA DRAWN SUCH SWIFT AND SWEEPING CONCLUSIONS. GORDON OEHLER~ WHO RETIRED LAST YEAR AS DIRECTOR OF THE CIA'S NONPROLIFERATION CENTER~ SAID THE GROUP OF INTEL ANALYSTS WHO INTERPRET SPY SATELLITE PHOTOS IS A FAR LESS SKILLED GROUP THAN IT WAS AT THE END OF THE COLD WAR. ANALYSTS NOW HAVE AN AVERAGE OF ABOUT 18 MONTHS' EXPERIENCE IN THEIR HIGHLY TECHNICAL TASKS~ SAID JEFFREY HARRIS~ A RECENTLY RETIRED DIRECTOR OF THE NRO. OEHLER SAID THE ^CONTRARIAN VIEWS^ ARE SOMETIMES DISREGARDED~ WHICH DISCOURAGES FRESH THINKING. JEREMIAH~ RECOMMENDED THE DCI MAKE CHANGES TO IMPROVE THE WAYS CIA AND [THE IC] GATHER INFO~ ANALYZE THAT INFO~ MANAGE THEIR EMPLOYEES AND TRAIN NEW PEOPLE. <NYT 6/3/98
